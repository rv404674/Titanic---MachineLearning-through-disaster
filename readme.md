# Titanic-Machine-Learning-through-disaster

## Description
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to 
such loss of life was that there were not lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, 
some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, machine learning is used to analyse what sort of people were likely to survive and data analytics to find some
hidden pattern in data.
